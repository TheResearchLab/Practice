# Test 1 A) Check inference times as you add more entries into the model registry table. This will only check how model performs as it is only searching for the most recent model for a single model.
# Test 1 B) Check max # of inferences that can be made per minute as model registry table grows
# Test 2 A) Check inference times as you add more entries of different model types requiring a selection of the most recent model of a given type... next will check for  most recent model, model type, and project id
# Test 2 B) Check max # of inferences that can be  made per minutes as model registry table grows.
# Test 3 A) Check inference times as you add more entries of different model types and project ids to the model registry table
# Test 3 A) Check max 3 of inferences that can be made per minute as the model registry table grows
