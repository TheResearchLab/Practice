------ Basic Decorator --------
- decorator is a function that takes a function
- bare function is the function that the decorator is applied to
- end result is a decorated function
- adding self to (*args,**kwargs) ie. (self,*args,**kwargs) turns decorator into a decorator that only works with funcs that at least have 1 arg.
- adding the self arg works for class methods
