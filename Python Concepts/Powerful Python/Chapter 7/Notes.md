--------- Chapter 7 Intro ---------
- Python, being a dynamically typed higher-level language, has design patterns that differ from the ones that were made for C++,C#, and the coffee language
--------- Properties ---------
- Author speaks about properties like a mix between methods and class members. Javascript also has properties 
- Setting properties at run-time might be useful for different calculations that could be done based on input params
- Maintaining internal variables and using getters and setters can allow developers code to be more maintainable.
--------- The Factory Patterns ---------
- Two patterns 1) Simple Factory Pattern & 2) Factory Method Pattern
- SFP is when the object type remains the same but want diff variations
- FMP is where factory can dynamically choose different types
--------- Alternative Constructors: The Simple Factory ---------
- One object type with different variations 
--------- Dynamic Type: The Factory Method Pattern ---------
- NA
--------- The Observer Pattern ---------
- observable has some event detection algorithm and the observer must know how to detect when an event occurred.
- Observers subscribe to the observable ie. pub-sub
--------- The Simple Observer ---------
--------- Magic Method ---------
- Negative modulos that are different signs from the denominator ie -7%3 will have denominator added to the numerator until the result is greater or equal than 0.
