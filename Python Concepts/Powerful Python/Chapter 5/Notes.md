------ Basic Decorator --------
- decorator is a function that takes a function
- bare function is the function that the decorator is applied to
- end result is a decorated function
- adding self to (*args,**kwargs) ie. (self,*args,**kwargs) turns decorator into a decorator that only works with funcs that at least have 1 arg.
- adding the self arg works for class methods
------ Data in Decorators --------
- data can be added in the decorator but outside the wrapper to keep track of data each time the function is called, but data only instantiated once.
- the nonlocal is used in cases where the container for a variable changes in memory. In the case of the variable changing nonlocal is needed because variable change unlike with the dictionary where the dictionaries contents change but not the variable holding the object.
